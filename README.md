# Heroku - Play - CRUD App

This simple application demonstrates a Play CRUD App on Heroku free instance using H2. I have noted that NoSQL databases available as Heroku add-on elements though free, require user identification is done via valid credit cards. I have avoided providing my credit card number, so I havent put a NoSQL example that I would have loved to get done using a NoSQL database.

But it is very simple to replace the 'h2' database with NoSQL database by changing the JDBC link, for example: by adding a simple Redis, Cassandra etc. The SORM framework used in this application wouldnt change as SORM frame work masks the database from the user.

A sample application on Heroku is at: https://secure-lowlands-84347.herokuapp.com/
